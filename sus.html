   <p ><h3> Happy birthday to the queen of my life.</h3> </p> 
   <p> You entered into my life as a candlelight in the dark. You showed me the meaning of love not with your words but with your care</p>
   <p>Without your love I can do nothing, with your love there is nothing I cannot do.
          you gave me courage,you taught me  life lessons.</p>
          <p>  you changed me and moulded me into strong and confident person that iam today</p>
          <p>To express the love that i feel for you is quite difficult for words are not enough to describe what can only be felt</p>
          <p>I can feel you close to me even though you're far away.Please believe me when I say I love you.</p>
          <p>             I love you and always will, my angel(sushulu :*)!!! </p>
